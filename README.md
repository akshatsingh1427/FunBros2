## Project Overview

FunBros2 is a fast-paced 2D platformer game developed using the Godot Engine and GDScript. The game focuses on smooth movement, precise timing, and engaging enemy interactions. Players can run, jump, roll, and navigate through colorful environments filled with traps and challenges.

The game currently includes **Level 1**, which is fully completed and playable, and **Level 2**, which expands the gameplay with higher difficulty and new challenges. These levels establish the core mechanics and overall flow of the game.

The **final level is currently in development**, and the **complete version of FunBros is planned for release soon**.

## Game Design Philosophy

FunBros is designed around the principle of simple mechanics with meaningful challenge. Each gameplay element is intentionally minimal, allowing players to focus on timing, movement precision, and decision-making rather than complex controls.

The design emphasizes fair enemy encounters, clear visual feedback, gradual difficulty progression, and fast respawn cycles. This approach helps players learn from mistakes while maintaining an engaging gameplay experience.
